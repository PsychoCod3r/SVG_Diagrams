**Introduction:**

This is just a repo I decided to make on the fly. It includes a bunch of
diagrams I did in SVG, which I have used as visuals on a couple articles
on my WordPress site.

**Why did I make this repository?**

Unlike my other repos which are devoted to specific projects, this one
doesn't really serve a set purpose. It's more just an archive for diagrams
I've done in SVG, because I thought others might find them interesting.
